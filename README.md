It is a copy of vector from the standard template library. It works the same way, but it has some more methods that I find useful and interesting. This project is open-source so you can use it in your works, IDK why you need it, but here you can add your custom methods. This vector is still supported so I will add more and more methods for comfortable work;
This class is compatible with an std::vector and will use std exceptions soon
